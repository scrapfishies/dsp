>> Cohen's d comparing birth weights of first born children and subsequent children is **-0.0887**, which is interpreted as the difference in means between the two populations is -0.089 standard deviations. In this study, first born children were, on average, lighter than subsequent children. 
>> Pregnancy Lengths: The first born children were, on average, in the womb longer than subsequent children. The Cohen's d statistic for pregnancy lengths was 0.029. 
>> The Cohen's d statistic is small in both categories.
